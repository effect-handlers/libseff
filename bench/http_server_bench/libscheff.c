    "CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her "
    "sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book "
    "her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <and what is the use "
    "of a book,> thought Alice <without pictures or conversations?> So she was considering in her "
    "own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), "
    "whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and "
    "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was "
    "nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to "
    "hear the Rabbit say to itself, <Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!> (when she thought it over "
    "afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it "
    "all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its "
    "waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it "
    "flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a "
    "waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across "
    "the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole "
    "under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in "
    "the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some "
    "way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about "
    "stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was "
    "very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about "
    "her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out "
    "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of "
    "the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards......";
